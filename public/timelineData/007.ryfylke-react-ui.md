Ryfylke React UI is a design system that me and
my brother, Eirik Underbakke, have been working
on for a few months.

The design system includes colors, spacing
tokens, typography, and some UI-components. You
can install a package for React from NPM (`@ryfylke-react/ui`) to use these
components.

I've always enjoyed making detailed, accessible
and reusable components. This project is a a
nice challenge for me to create a collection of
matching components that go well together.

The design system takes some heavy inspiration
from libraries such as Carbon Design System,
and Material-UI.

My latest portfolio design is built using
Ryfylke React UI.
