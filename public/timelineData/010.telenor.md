  Working as a front-end consultant on a project related to log analysis and correlation of data.
type: project
---

Since February of 2021, I've been working as a
front-end consultant on a project at Telenor, a
Norwegian telecommunications company.

The project I'm working on is related to log
analysis and correlation of messages and log
data from hardware and software.

Although I can't disclose too much about the
project, I can say that it's been an amazing
learning experience. I've been able to work on
complex data visualisation components, and
other interesting things such as working with
websockets, writing functional and unit tests,
setting up a good developer experience, and
much more.

This is my own company's first contract - and I
will most likely be working on this for the
whole of 2021, possibly extending onwards.
