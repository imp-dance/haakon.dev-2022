This was a short project to create a
network-simulation game to be used in
IT-education on the Norwegian Digital Learning
Arena. The objective of the game is to connect
various nodes through switches to the network,
and to map the correct networks to the correct
devices. The design of the game was made by a
Senior Visual Designer at Idean, and I worked
on implementing the design myself.

The game is made in React.JS with Typescript
and styled-components.
